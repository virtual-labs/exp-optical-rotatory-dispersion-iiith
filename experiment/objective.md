 The purpose of this lab is to make students familiar with different types of ORD spectra obtained from different chiral substances. By doing this experiment user will be able to,

   1. Develop an understanding about assigning R and S configuration to chiral structures.  
   2. Relate plain ORD curves and their sign with absolute configuration of sample.  
   3. Understand why anomalous ORD or Cotton effect is observed.
